 - Start a new session: tmux
 - Detach from session: Ctrl + b followed by d
 - List sessions: tmux ls
 - Attach to session: tmux a or tmux a -t session_name
 - Create new window: Ctrl + b followed by c
 - Switch between windows: Ctrl + b followed by 0, 1, etc. (or n for next, p for previous)
 - Split window vertically: Ctrl + b followed by %
 - Split window horizontally: Ctrl + b followed by "
 - Navigate between panes: Ctrl + b followed by arrow keys
 - Kill current pane: Ctrl + b followed by x
 - Kill current window: Ctrl + b followed by &

Repetition Drill Sequence (Daily Practice)
 - Open terminal → Run tmux
 - Create 3 windows: c, c, c
 - Name them: Ctrl + b → , → type code, server, logs
 - Split window vertically → Ctrl + b → %
 - Split one pane horizontally → Ctrl + b → "
 - Move between all 4 panes using arrow keys
 - Run ls in one pane, top in another, vim in a third
 - Switch back to window 1 → Ctrl + b → 0
 - Kill the logs window → Ctrl + b → &
 - Detach → Ctrl + b → d
 - Reattach → tmux a
 - Repeat steps 1–10 5 times daily for 5 days. 
Advanced Repetition: Session & Window Management
 - Create named session: tmux new -s dev
 - Switch between sessions: Ctrl + b → s
 - Rename session: Ctrl + b → $
 - Kill session: tmux kill-session -t dev
 - Reattach to last session: tmux a
 - Use fzf for session/window switching (if installed): Ctrl + b → f (requires fzf setup)
